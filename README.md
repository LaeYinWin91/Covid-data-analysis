# Covid-data-analysis
This is personal project about worldwide Covid-19 data analysis. The data is downloaded from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths.  For data cleaning and analysis, I use SQL to analyze and use Tableau to do visualization. For visualization, please follow the link https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/lae.win/viz/CovidDashboardproject1/Dashboard1.

Findings
The data shows that total death count is highest in North America and lowest in Oceania. Meanwhile, if compared to total cases of Covid-19, the death percentage is only 1.26.
On the other hand, the average percentage of infected population is increasing yearly and expected to increase in the future. 
Recommendation
In order to reduce the infected population, should encourage more on self-protection. In addition, should do research on medicine that can cure Covid-19.
